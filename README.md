# MuzInfo ðŸŽ¶

I present my music application called... MuzInfo. It is used to provide information about music albums of different artists. **React.js** was used to create this app, **react-redux** helps manage application state. Data provided by  *https://www.apple.com/itunes/*, fetched using **axios** and **redux-thunk**. To create styles I used **styled-components** and **styled-icons** . Components are organized according to *atomic design*. Additionally, I used **cors-bridge** to avoid problems with *cors policy*.
